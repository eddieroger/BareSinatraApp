BareSinatraApp
==============

You know what's frustrating? Repeating yourself. I do that a lot. I mean, all the time.

Specifically, when I'm starting a new project in my current DSL du jour, Sinatra, I seem to have a basic set of needs that repeats itself over and over again.

I like to write in the Modular style. I like to have some basic authentication. I don't want to remember to write my config.ru or init.rb files.

And thus, on a snowy Christmas morning in Indiana, this project was born.

Jewish people do funny things on Christmas. Don't worry - I will see a movie and eat Chinese, but for now, it's creating a Sinatra app.

Why?

A good question. The world doesn't need another barebones starter app. But, find any developer out there and ask them if they've ever inherited code that they didn't want to refactor.

They will all say "Of course - the last guy sucked."

That's how I feel. But mostly because I only know my coding style. I know what I need and want out of a development experience, not what others tell me I want. Sure, I can learn from them, and have, but it's time for me to contribute what I think is a good basic app to the world.

Plus, it pads the resume. Hello, public repo.

A better answer would have just been, "why not?"
